			<h3>Goal In Life</h3>
			<p>After graduating from college, I will become successful by being a pediatrician. A pediatrician is a medical practitioner specializing in children and their diseases. To become a pediatrician you need about 4 years of college and 4 years of medical school. After that 8 years of schooling, you will need 3 years of training. A pediatrician takes 11 years of school. As a pediatrician you will always be learning.
<br><br>
	A pediatrician makes a great amount of money. The annual salary of a pediatrician is about $175,000.00 a year. But for a monthly salary it is about $14,583.00. Also a pediatrician works a good amount of hours. The job a pediatrician has, goes to hospitals to make rounds and see new infants and sick children. They go into the regular office at 8:00am and gets out around 6:30 pm.
<br><br>
	The reasons that I want to be a pediatrician is for so many reasons. One reason is because I want to be in the medical field. Another reason is because I want to be able to help infants, children, and teens. I see a lot of children sick with diseases and I want to help cure them. Also because a pediatrician can practically get a job anywhere. Even if you move to another state, there are plenty of jobs for pediatricians. This is why becoming a pediatrician is such a big goal to me in life.

			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>I have two interests in my future that is bound to come. My first is to move to South Carolina for college. The reason I want to move there is because the schooling there is amazing. I also want to be closer to my mom’s family. I love to go there during the summer. South Carolina is like my second home.<br><br>
	If I don’t move to South Carolina, I want to be in the Air Force because I want to be in the medical field. I also think that the Air Force would be an amazing experience. It would also help me stay out of trouble in my future. These are great interests that I have. I am glad that I have these ideas for my future. I may even do both of them.

			<h3>Family Is Everything</h3>
			<p>I live with a family of 5 and there is me, Alexis Quintana. I have 2 brothers and 1 sister. Plus my two amazing parents. My family is always together. I want to start with my mom. My mom (Honey) is my best friend, my sister and my beautiful mom. She is always there for me in a time of need. She makes sure that I have whatever I want or need. My dad (Leonard) is a very hard working man. He supports my family by going to work every morning. <br><br>
	I also want to talk about my sister and two brothers. My sister is one of my best friends. She is a person that I can go to for advice. My oldest brother is a great big brother. He has blessed our family with little girl named Keira Grace. The baby in my family is my littlest brother. He is such a great kid. He is very athletic. His favorite sport is basketball. My family is a blessing to me. I wouldn’t want to have it any other way.

			<h3>8th Grade Memories</h3>
			<p>The best memory that I have for 8th grade is basketball season. Basketball was so amazing this year. Our tournaments is a memory that will last a lifetime. We were so close to taking the championship. The Antonito team beat us by a couple of points. It was such a close game. Even when some team mates got hurt.
 <br><br>
	We had four 8th graders go out and one got hurt during a scrimmage and the other one got hurt during tournaments. We did amazing in tournaments, because our first game we lost to them by 40 some points. Also for Basketball, the practices were the best. We didn’t do much. Our season was crazy. One of our players got a technical. These were the best memories of 8th grade.
