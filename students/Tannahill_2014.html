			<h3>Memorable Moments</h3>
			<p>This is some of my most memorable moments in my 8th grade year. One of the most memorable moments is when I took a star reading and got a 9.1 grade level in my reading test. This means that I am at a 9th grade level and I can read 9th grade or higher. When i got this score I was surprised because normally I get at least 8.0 - 8.5 and that is not that bad but it is still not a good score. But the 9.1 shows that the I am at least above grade level. The second most memorable moment is when I took the star math was a score of 11. And that means that I tested at an 11th grade level which is really cool  because I sow that I can do 11th grade math. And I hope to keep on doing good in the future.
The last most memorable moment I had is when my uncle graduated college with a bachelors degree in computer science. He got honors in his class with a 4.0 gpa through college. He is getting a good job as a computer programmer at a high security military base, and has a secret location. And one day I will be just like him. And I want to graduate college with honors in my class.

			<h3>Family</h3>
			<p>My family is the ones who helped me get through school. They are the ones that want me to do good in school so that I can get a good job when I grow up. My family is the best thing I could ever ask for.When I think of my family I think of the ones who gave me advice on how to get though the problem that I have faced over the years. WHen I had trouble my family was there to help. I will love my family no matter how boring they can be. And sometimes they can be very grumpy and not so easy to get along with. And that is the good part about my family. My family is the ones that I can depend on to help me.

			<h3>Interest</h3>
			<p>My academic interests are Mathematics, Science, some types of History, and Computer Programming. The reason why I choose these academic interests is because I can see some type of future with these subjects. Math and Computer Programming are the best academic subjects in this school. Because when you do math you can learn a lot of new things in math and there is never enough to learn in math. In Computer Programming you learn how to program things to do the things you donâ€™t like to do. Sooner or later the main job in the future is going to be Computer Programming. Now the reason why I picked History and Science is because they can be very interesting and you can learn a lot. When I am in my Science class I learn how they think our Earth was created. You learn so much in science and that is what makes it so interesting. In History you learn a lot about what the USA looked like and how they lived like before now. 
My life interests consist of Cooking, Playing Games, Shooting, and Loving my family and loving dogs.The reason why I choose these life interests are because they all represent me as a person.Some reason are because  I love my family and my love for dogs.The reason why I choose these things because I really love my family even though they can be annoying. And the reason why I choose dog s is because I like dog because they are really good companions. And the others are just really good hobbies. 
Then my interests that consists of school and life are Sports, Art, Music, Building, and Technology. The three most fun and good ones are Sports, Building, and Technology. The reason why I chose these ones are because they are the best and most fun one I do. When I do sports I like to play two types of sports and they are football and basketball when I play those sports I feel like i am one of the best players on the team. And when I do technology like Computer programing I feel like I will have a future because the future will most likely have robots to do our work.Then when I have some free time I do some building with building material like for example I always build model cars and stuff like that. When I do this I feel like I have a future in this. Then I picked Art, and Music, and when I do these things I really enjoy doing these things but I will just do these things as a hobby.   </p>
