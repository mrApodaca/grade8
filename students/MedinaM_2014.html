			<h3>My Life Goals</h3>
			<p>After graduating college, I will become a successful anesthesiologist. An anesthesiologist is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  Anesthesia is a temporary state that causes unconsciousness, loss of memory, and lack of pain and muscle relaxation. Anesthesia is the use of medicine to prevent the feeling of pain or sensation during the operation. There are three types of anesthesia; General anesthesia, Regional anesthesia, and Local anesthesia. 
<br><br>
General anesthesia is anesthesia to make the patient completely unconscious. General anesthesia can be given through IV or by inhaling gases or vapors.  An example of general anesthesia is when an anesthesiologist puts a patient to sleep to work on major surgery.  Major surgery can mean a lot of things, but one example is when somebody has a broken ankle they will need to be given the general anesthesia.  This type of anesthesia is used when people need major surgeries.
 <br><br>
	Regional anesthesia is an anesthetic drug that is injected near nerves, and also numbing larger areas of the body.  This type of anesthesia is used on mostly people who are overweight. Regional anesthesia helps the anesthesiologists guide the correct placement of the needle in overweight people. When this type of anesthesia is given the patient is usually asleep before the procedure is finished. Regional anesthesia is more for the overweight people.
 <br><br>
	Local anesthesia only numbs a small specific part of the body. This type of anesthesia is used when you go for minor surgeries. An example of a minor surgery is when a person has to go for stitches. When local anesthesia is given the person may be awake or asleep. This anesthesia is given certain amounts that the patient can handle or that is needed. 
<br><br>
	When I graduate college, I will become a successful anesthesiologist. When I was researching all these different types of anesthesia I was very interested. I would want to be an anesthesiologist for many reasons. I would want to experience giving all the types of anesthesia to people.  I know I can accomplish if I follow my dreams and don’t let anyone bring me down.

			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>When people ask me about my interests I don’t know what to say.  I don’t know what to say because of the fact that I want to accomplish many things in life. I have many interests in life and academics. If I follow my dreams I know that I will be able to accomplish all the things I want. I will be able to become whatever I want in life with the support of my fellow peers. 
<br><br>
	My academic interests are in math, science and English. My life interests are becoming an anesthesiologist, and having a volleyball career. All in all my interests for everything are playing sports. My favorite sports are volleyball and basketball. If I didn’t have both of these sports in my life I wouldn’t know what to do. My life is full of dreams, and all I have to do is succeed.

			<h3>My Family</h3>
			<p>My family is the absolute best. When people think of my family they probably think crazy and loud. My family is supportive in many ways. When I’m out there trying doing my best in whatever I can, my family is always there with me. I wouldn’t trade my family for the world. My family is everything to me and I wouldn’t ask for anything better.
 <br><br>
	My family will do anything for me and I will do anything for them.  When it comes to family we always stick together no matter what. My family may be loud and obnoxious but I love them. I couldn’t be more thankful than what I am today. I would like to thank each and every one of my family members for doing what they do for me. I love you all!

			<h3>Most Memorable 8th Grade Memories</h3>
			<p>
	My 8th grade memories are the best. I have so many memories this year that I will treasure with me throughout my life. I have memories with my class, my volleyball team, my basketball team, and my family. A memory with my volleyball team is when we always used to go to McDonald’s and we would act like we were two again and play in the play place. One memory of my basketball team is when Jessica hurt herself. Right then and there when she told me she couldn’t play I knew I had lost my partner.
 <br><br>
	My memories with my class and my family are funny.  My class memories are ridiculous. We have memories with everyone just not 5 or 6 of us. In class we come up with the funniest things ever to do.  We tell jokes, we prank people, we laugh, but most of all we have fun. My family memories are just great as well. As a family we go camping, vacations, dinners, and gatherings.  We all laugh, fight, argue, and have fun. I have so many memories that I can’t just describe one.
