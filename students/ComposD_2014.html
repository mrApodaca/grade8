			<h3>Success Path</h3>
			<p>My life goal for the future is to graduate High School and to go off to College.Im going to college to go and get my princiapls lisence. After college i will go and teach at a School District for 2 years and then become the principal. The reason why i'm going to teach for 2 years before i become the principal is because your have to have 2 years in teaching before you can become a principal. I will hope to be the principal for 4 years after being a principal i will go back to college to go and get my doctoral degree for math. After i get my doctoral degree i will go to be a professor at adam state university.When im done teaching as a professor i will try starting my own business selling home improvement items at a local and online store. I hope to make lots of money in my future so that i can take my family to places they want to go and to be able to live well off.I will also try to go to flight school to go and get my pilots license so that i can go and work for American Airlines and fly one of there biggest plane that they have.. </p>
