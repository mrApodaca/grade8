			<h3>Family</h3>
			<p>My family is a funny, wild, and hard working hispanic family.</p>
                       <p>I live on a ranch in San Acacio. My dad has cows, horses, and pigs. My family manages a lot of land. We grow about 500 acres of alfalfa and graze about 1500 acres. Everyday on Quintana Ranch is amazing and fun.</p> 
                       <p>During the summers we work on the ranch. Summer is my favorite time of year. No matter what we do someone makes it fun. We can be taking down fences, bucking bales, or cutting willows and someone will still make it fun. Although we mess around and have fun, we still work. We do anything from cutting willows and taking down fences to working on vehicles and moving animals.</p>

			<h3>Interests</h3>
			<p>My passion is working on the ranch, being social, and playing sports. </p>
	             	<p>I enjoy being active. I like playing sports and running. My favorite sports are basketball and wrestling. I also like to help my dad work on the ranch. He teaches me a lot about the farm and water.</p>

			<h3>Life Goals</h3>
			<p>My life goal is to run a ranch.</p>
                        <p>I want to live on a ranch with some animals. I want to own cows, horses, pigs, dogs, and own my own land to farm. I want horses so I can move my cows and go hunting on. I will farm my land how my dad does and I want my house will be near a river with fish in it.</p>
                  		<p>Getting a degree from college is another goal I have. I want to go to school to study science and math. Math and science can help me later in life. Math can help me manage my money and science can help me better understand how to grow plants and take care of my animals. When Iâ€™m in college I want to run for my school. If I can remain running after I graduate high school, I will have successfully completed my running goal. </p>
