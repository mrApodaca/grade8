			<h3>My life goals </h3>
			<p>After I graduate high school I will try my hardest to go to college. When I go to college I will go to be a CSI Investigator. I will have to go to college for four years or more. Ever since my teacher showed me a video in class about CSI, I fell in love with it. Thats when I knew I wanted to be a CSI investigator.</p> 
 			<p>  I would like to be a CSI Investigator because its cool. I would like to go investigate murder scenes. CSI Investigators investigate crime scenes to try to find out who the murderer is. Theres times that they get the wrong person, but they usually end up finding out who it really was. </p>
<p>  CSI Investigators have all kinds of fancy technology that help them figure out clues. When they are looking at pictures of the dead bodies, they compare them to others to see if they have a match, and if they did then that would mean that they have a serial killer out. I would love to learn how to use the technology, to try to find out who was the murderer.  </p>

			<h3>Interest</h3>
			<p>My interest in life are kinda different than others in the school. In life I would like to go to college to go and be a CSI Investigator. I would also like to go to college and get a volleyball career. I would like to have a volleyball career for multiple reasons. One, because I love the sport a lot. Two, because volleyball is an awesome sport to have fun with your friends and its a very competitive sport. I would also like to go and play with girls that are very good at it and that I can learn from.</p>
		<p> CSI  Investigator is another thing I would love to be. I think its the best job out there for me. I like it because I get to be out there investigating crime scenes. I get to find out who the murderer is and find clues. My academics in college would be math, english, and science. I would need all three of the things to be a CSI Investigator. A CSI  Investigator and a Volleyball creere are things that I would like to do in my future.</p>

		<h3>Most Memorable Event</h3>
			<p>This year isn't over yet, but its definitely been the best year in junior high. Most of the good memories were from sports. This one time for volleyball we were playing against Centauri, we were so close to beating them. Then for the last round we lost. We were all very sad that we lost. At first we were undefeated then when we lost to Centauri. Mariah, Ayla, and I had a very good last year in junior high in volleyball, we had lots of fun. We would all like to thank Roberta for making this a good volleyball year. </p>
      <p> When basketball season started we kinda started off to a good start. Mariah and I were very close, we were like partners in crime for basketball. For our 4th game against Sanford I had hurt my knee, and it wasn’t even for a game that counted it was just a scrimmage. That next day I went to the doctor, she had told me that I wasn’t going to be able to play for the rest of the year. When she told me that I started to cry.  </p>
        <p> When I told Mariah that I couldn’t play, we were both pretty sad. That Thursday we had a game against Garland, and that game was pretty important to us. Every time, the time would get closer for the eighth graders to play Mariah and I started to cry. We would just sit there and look at each other and start to cry again. That was the first game in all season that we weren’t going to be able to play with each other. Then when tournaments came around I got to play for the last two games. I was very excited and really scared that I was going to hurt my knee again.   This is the most memorable thing thats happened to me this year.<p>

			<h3>My Family</h3>
			<p>I have a loving, caring, and strict family, There are way more ways to describe my family but I think that these three words are the best way to describe them. I say loving because we all care and love each othe. We all love each other no matter what. Sometimes we might fight, but at the end we all still love each other. We also all care for each other. We protect one another from a lot of things. <p>
		<p> My parents are strict with me at times. My dad is the worse one, but I understand why. My mom is  too but she’s not that bad. My dad has multiple reasons for being strict. One because I’m a girl. Two, because I’m the baby of the family, and three, he doesn’t want me to go get in any trouble that will haunt me for the rest of my life. He’s just protecting me like a dad should . I love my family a lot, and I wouldn’t give them up for anything. </p>
